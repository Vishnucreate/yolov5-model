Object Detection with YOLOv5 and COCO Dataset
This project showcases object detection using the YOLOv5 model with the COCO dataset. The YOLOv5 model is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that provides fast and accurate detection of objects in images.

Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

Download and prepare the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for object detection.
Integrate the COCO dataset with the YOLOv5 model for object detection.
Perform object detection on the COCO validation set using the trained YOLOv5 model.
Display the detected objects and their bounding boxes on the images.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or higher
torch
torchvision
yolov5
pycocotools
Usage
Follow the steps below to use this project:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/example/object-detection-yolov5-coco.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install torch torchvision yolov5 pycocotools

python

Download and prepare the COCO dataset:
Download the COCO images zip file from http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip and http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip.
Download the COCO annotations zip file from http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip.
Extract the downloaded zip files and place the images in the coco/images/ directory and the annotations in the root directory.
Run the object detection script:
python object_detection.py

csharp

This script uses the YOLOv5 model and the COCO dataset to perform object detection on the COCO validation set. The detected objects and their bounding boxes are displayed on the images.
